# My Portfolio

## Description

- I wanted to have a deployed webpage that contains and displays information about myself, and my web development skills
- I did this project to create a portfolio for potential employers to be able to access and view my work
- The page is easy to navigate, so in turn is easy to get the information a potential employer may want to see. 
- In creating My Portfolio, I discovered just how surprisngly comfortable I am writing HTML. I also learned a lot about CSS, but more importantly I learned how much I STILL have to learn about CSS.
